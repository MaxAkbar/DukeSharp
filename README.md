# DukeSharp
Duke Nukem 3D ported to C# Unity

Duke Nukem 3D C# Unity is a complete port of the original Dukem Nukem 3D 1.4 atomic edition source code to c#. 
The build engine code is a complete port of the original code as well, with the exception of the pragmas which came from JonoF's port.

The CON code has also been ported to C#, and is now called DukeScript. The DukeScript project can be found: https://github.com/jmarshall23/DukeSharp/tree/master/Scripts DukeSharp does not load the original CON files. If you are looking to port over a existing mod to DukeSharp I have coded a CON to C# converter, which will get you 90% of the way there: https://github.com/jmarshall23/DukeSharp/tree/master/Tools/Conport

The game is fully playable, there are no known show stopper bugs.
